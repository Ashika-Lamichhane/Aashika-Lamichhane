                By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, 
                where they had earlier evolved.[29][30][31] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date
                 to about 30,000 years ago.[32] The oldest discovered archaeological evidence of human settlements in Nepal
                  dates to around the same time.[33]
                After 6500 BC, evidence for the domestication of food crops and animals,
                construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in
                 what is now Balochistan.[34] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[35][34] the first urban 
                 culture in South Asia.[36] Prehistoric sites of palaeolithic, mesolithic and neolithic origins have been discovered in 
                 the Siwalik hills of Dang district.[37] The earliest inhabitants of modern Nepal and adjoining areas are believed to 
                 be people from the Indus Valley Civilisation. It is possible that the Dravidian people whose history predates the
                  onset of the Bronze Age in the Indian subcontinent (around 6300 BC) inhabited the area before the arrival of other
                   ethnic groups like the Tibeto-Burmans and Indo-Aryans from across the border.[38] By 4000 BC, the Tibeto-Burmese
                    people had reached Nepal either directly across the Himalayas from Tibet or via Myanmar and north-east India or 
                    both.[39] Stella Kramrisch (1964) mentions a substratum of a race of pre-Dravidians and Dravidians, who were in 
                    Nepal even before the Newars, who formed the majority of the ancient inhabitants of the valley of Kathmandu.[40]

                Geography<i>Main  articals: Geography of Nepal and Geology of Nepal</i>
                A topography map of Nepal
                Nepal is of roughly trapezoidal shape, about 800 kilometres (500 mi) long and 200 kilometres (120 mi) wide,
                 with an area of 147,516 km2 (56,956 sq mi). It lies between latitudes 26° and 31°N, and longitudes 80° and 89°E.
                  Nepal's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian plate, then part of the southern 
                  supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later,
                   south and south-east.[76] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyn oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under
                    the Eurasian Plate.[76] These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's mantle, both created the Indian 
                    Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas.[76] 
                    The rising barriers blocked the paths of rivers creating large lakes, which only broke through as late as 100,000 
                    years ago, creating fertile valleys in the middle hills like the Kathmandu Valley. In the western region, rivers 
                    which were too strong to be hampered, cut some of the world's deepest gorges.[77] Immediately south of the emerging
                     Himalayas, plate movement created a vast trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment[78] and now 
                     constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain.[79] Nepal lies almost completely within this collision zone, occupying the 
                     central sector of the Himalayan arc, nearly one-third of the 2,400 km (1,500 mi)-long Himalayas,[80][81][82][83]
                     [84][85] with a small strip of southernmost Nepal stretching into the Indo-Gangetic plain and two districts in the
                      northwest stretching up to the Tibetan plateau.[77]

                Economy
                Nepal is one of the least developed countries, which ranks 165th in the world[k] in nominal GDP per capita[187] 
                and 162nd[l] in GDP per capita at PPP.[188] Nepal's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2019 was $34.186 billion.[189]
                [190] Nepal has consistently been ranked as one of the poorest countries in the world.[191][192][193] Nepal has been a
                 member of WTO since 23 April 2004.[194]

                The 16.8-million-worker Nepali labour force is the 37th largest in the world.[195] The primary sector makes up 27.59% 
                of GDP, the secondary sector 14.6%, and the tertiary sector 57.81%.[196] Nepal's foreign exchange remittances of US$8.1
                 billion in 2018, the 19th largest in the world and constituting 28.0% of GDP,[197] were contributed to its economy by 
                 millions of workers primarily in India, the Middle East and East Asia, almost all of them unskilled labourers.[198]
                 [199] Major agricultural products include cereals (barley, maize, millet, paddy and wheat), oilseed, potato, pulses, 
                 sugarcane, jute, tobacco, milk and water buffalo meat.[200][201] Major industries include tourism, carpets, textiles, 
                 cigarettes, cement, brick, as well as small rice, jute, sugar and oilseed mills.[200] Nepal's international trade 
                 greatly expanded in 1951 with the establishment of democracy; liberalisation began in 1985 and picked up pace after 
                 1990. By the fiscal year 2016/17, Nepal's foreign trade amounted Rs 1.06 trillion, a twenty-three folds increase from
                  Rs 45.6 billion in 1990/91. More than 60% of Nepal's trade is with India. Major exports include readymade garment, 
                  carpet, pulses, handicrafts, leather, medicinal herbs, and paper products, which account for 90% of the total. Major
                   imports include various finished and semi-finished goods, raw materials, machinery and equipment, chemical 
                   fertilisers, electrical and electronic devices, petroleum products, gold, and readymade garments.[202] Inflation was
                    at 4.5% in 2019.[203] Foreign exchange reserves were at US$9.5 billion in July 2019, equivalent to 7.8 months of 
                    imports.[203]
